# Get your API keys from: https://apps.twitter.com/

# in the end i didn't bother with the API, so here's how you do it:
# 1. Install the Chrome Extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/copy-links/kcpoommnneaebpfgaoejklgemonkmjpc/related?hl=en
# 2. Go to the Twitter Feed in question to archive links from.
# 3. (Important) Scroll down on the twitter feed until you have all the twitter posts you want to gather links from.
# 4. On the top right toolbar, click the `<a>` icon and click "Copy All Links".
# 5. Paste this list to a text editor and winnow out the posts you don't need using grep or regex.
# 6. Some of the links you want may be shortened into t.co links. If so, use the Python Library unshortenit to deshorten these links en masse.
